# Hello
Hi, Nice to meet you. My name is Ridwan.

## Socials
I am on *X*, **LinkedIn** and ~~GitHub~~.
I hope my data journey is an interesting one!!!

use `SELECT *` to get all field from a table

-works well
-very short
    -and handy too

Example
```
SELECT * FROM employees
```
I use [GitHub](github.com) and use `git status` too
